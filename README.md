## Behaviour Driven Development

BDD focuses on how the user will interact with the application.

What you will see and experience:
1. On the terminal, you'll confirm whether you have an account or not.
2. If no, you'll be prompted to enter a username and a password. A choice to generate a password is also available.
3. Application will confirm that an account has been created and revert to ask whether you have an acc, this time you can respond with yes and log in.
4. Once logged in, you will be presented with shortcodes that will aid in navigation.
5. Shortcode - **cc** will allow you to create a credential. You will be prompted to enter an account name e.g facebook, a username, an email and a password. An option to generate a password for the account is also provided.
6. Shortcode - **dc** will allow you to display all the credentials in the acc.
7. Shortcode - **fc** will allow you to search for an account using the account name provided.
8. Shortcode - **ex** will allow you to exit the application.
